# Among Us Sankey Diagram
###### Author: Jonah Gaudet

When the HTML site is opened in a browser and the input fields are filled in, it generates a Sankey Diagram based on Among Us game stats entered by the user.

The site will generate alerts if and when invalid input is provided, along with a brief description of the issue. It only accepts numbers in the input fields, assumes that empty fields are zeroes, and fields set to zero are not represented in the resulting diagram

In order to find the relevant Among Us stats, select the statistics button at the bottom of the home page or visit this page for a more detailed description: https://www.talkesport.com/guides/how-to-check-stats-in-among-us/
